INSTALL

To install .emacs.d just get a copy of this directory to
~/.emacs.d so that this file is located in ~/.emacs.d/doc/INSTALL

Furthermore create a new file ~/.emacs.el and enter the following
code:

(load-library "~/.emacs.d/conf/.emacs.el")

If there are more files which match the pattern
~/.emacs.d/conf/.emacs.*.el then you can just load one of these
instead. Each should be fully operatable.
