1. Concepts

These are the basic concepts of the .emacs.d folder.  First of all
some definitions.  
  ~ := Directory .emacs.d is located in (normally the home directory)

  lib := Every package or *.el file downloaded from external sources
  will be stored in this directory conf := Every customization except
  .emacs.el will be stored in here, even a copy of .emacs.el will be
  stored here. ~/.emacs.el will just redirect to one of these files. 

  doc := This directory will hold every kind of documentation
  generated by me.

	doc/SOURCES := This file has links to all the packages in the lib
	directory. It has the form {packagename} : {link_to_download} ;
	{further_information}

	doc/MUTATIONS := This file will hold each change of the package
	files created by me. The format is not that strict. A guidline is
	{packagename} : {line}
	- {old_lines}
	+ {new_lines}

	conf := This directory will hold all the customizations for
	emacs. Furthermore each file matching .emacs.*.el can be used as a
	initialization file.

	conf/lib := Each package will have its own customization file. This
	way it is easy to embedd it into different .emacs.el files. 

	doc/INSTALL := Instructions for installation

2. Why this burden?

Emacs has the tendency to mess up the .emacs.el file. After some time
it is really hard to understand what is going on. It is even more
troublesome to update a package to a new version.

With this approach it will be much easier to control everything.
